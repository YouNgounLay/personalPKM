**Kinesthetic-ISFP** Learner 
- Introverted
- Sensing
- Feeling
- Perceiving

## How ISFPs acquire, memorise and recollect information:
- Response strongly to the appeal of learning complicated but productive material. For some, that may be how attractive they'll appear when speaking French in Paris; for others it's the desire to obtain a set of knowledge to complete a well-rounded series or establish a desirable title.
- They want to enjoy the learning process, as that is part of the beauty of the bigger picture 
- ISFP is a visual learner through and through
- They are concerned with being able to apply the material to their life as soon as possible. 
- They benefit from understanding a situation or way of life much more so than by listening to a lecture or studying a book. 
- They learn at a moderate pace and thrive when learning from multiple scenarios or examples rather than one strict format.
- They learn thing quickly and with fervent passion if it touches your emotions. They thrive through connection to the material and they hold onto what they learn for the long term. 
- They need thorough details and examples to grasp the nuances of situations.
- They have a moderate ability to work through stressful learning situations and often prefer not to evenly spread the learning process over a set period of time. 
- Despite often resorting to procrastination, they typically do manage to see through the projects in the end. 

## Optimal Learning Situations
1. Feeling and emotions come into play when learning new material
2. Good-looking presentation and visually stunning material
3. Group study sessions and group work 
4. Study materials are readily available

## Where the ISFP struggles
1. Theoretical Situations
2. They are unable to see the practical use for the knowledge 
3. No visual aids are available

## Learning Style Distribution

| Name        | Percentage |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| Visual      | 25.9%      |
| Auditory    | 25.9%      |
| Kinesthetic | 48.1%      |

### Kinesthetic Learner 

**Traits** - are a physical bunch. They like to touch, taste, smell, and be active within the lesson in order to best process and remember what they are learning. They struggle when a lesson or activity is too sedentary. There are two types of kinesthetic learners:
1. Kinesthetic (movement) learner
	1. Are all about getting involved. This type wants to deep dive where they are fully engaged with the material and can learn from the experience. External stimulation is the key to success.
2. Tactile (touch) learner
	1. they have trouble sitting still - but it's not just about motion. They often opt to write down what they learn just to feel their hand move, and often want to peruse and overview of lesson before getting into specifics. When traveling, they do much better looking at a map once in the location than prior to arrival, as they can place themselves in the map and figure it out from there. 

Tips from optimising the kinesthetic learning experience:
1. Make activities as active as possible. When learning a new language, engage in conversation regularly. 
2. Background music or other audio stimulation tends to help kinesthetic learners engage with and retain information.
3. Highlight key points and/or draw sketches of the material.
4. Take your time when working through a lesson to make sure you are fully engaged with what is being taught.
5. Sensual stimuli such as foods, drinks,  and physical objects that the learner can touch or interact with can be of immense help
6. Make complex tasks visual and interactive. 

### Visual 

**Traits** - can be divided into the more specific types. Both take in information by having time to process what they see, however memorisation and understanding is triggered in vastly different ways. Let's take a look at both types. 
1. *Visual-linguistic Learners* - best process information through writing and reading, thrive in lessons presented in text-driven formats, and are quite keen on taking notes. They memorise information through exercises that draw on their linguistic strengths and are able to express themselves sincerely through words.
2. *Visual-Spatial Learners* - are still visual learners - but in a strikingly different manner. Words are not their forte; they instead prefer images, infographics, and artistic rendering. The visual-spatial learner is the person who remembers the face of someone he/she met as a young child, despite not seeing the person for decades. They memorise places, sights, and locations by taking a mental picture and using the image to process associated feelings.

Tips for optimising the visual learning experience:
1. Build lessons and assignments around visual aids.
2. Use attachments such as maps, itineraries, articles, and photos to process and memorise information and be able to recall it later.
3. Take notes - whether that be text, drawing, or charts. Always make sure you're taking something with you at the end of a lesson!
4. Go through notes and ask questions - then modify as needed. 
5. Pay attention to pauses in a lesson - these are a great opportunity to ensure you have everything jotted down or drawn out.
6. Minimise audible or visual distractions.
7. Draw sketches/take notes in the margins of a page. In white space below paragraphs, or anywhere else that you have a room.  

### Auditory

**Traits** - gain from, enjoy and practice exactly what the name suggests. There are a few common and noticeable traits of auditory learners. For example, they often talk out loud to themselves, a process that helps them process thoughts and ideas and gives them a chance to clear their mind. When reading, auditory learners are known to recite that out loud, they'll move their lips as they read. While they benefit greatly from speaking, the auditory learner often struggles with remembering what they read, or in putting their thoughts to paper. 

Tips for optimising the auditory learning experience:
- Begin lessons and presentations with an overview of the process.
- Finish a document or presentation with a summary, giving the auditory learner a chance to recap. This is the old adage of "tell them what they are going to lean, teach them, and tell them what they have learned."
- Employing the Socratic method of lecturing a preferred way to help the auditory learner absorb the material presented to them. It allows them to both take information from a lesson and use their own knowledge to fill in the gaps. 
- Auditory learners typically react well to inclusive activities, ideation sessions where topics are written on a blackboard, for instance, give them the chance to not only speak their ideas but to see them written down. This triggers memory and often leads to productive deep dives on a specific topic.
- Recitation activities also resonate well with auditory learners. The more conversational, the better!
